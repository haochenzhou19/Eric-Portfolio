    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Iâ€™m an Economics graduate with a passion for <strong>data-driven decision-making</strong> and <strong>process improvement</strong>. Currently, I work as a Supply Chain Specialist at Trinity Health, where I help manage and forecast medical inventory across hospital departments.</p>
    <p>My background in economics and history trained me to interpret data, evaluate trade-offs, and communicate clearly â€” skills that translate naturally to improving operational efficiency.</p>
    <p>Iâ€™m driven by continuous learning and aim to bridge operational expertise with analytical insight to drive smarter, sustainable business decisions.</p>
    <p>For a full list of my certifications and professional experience, please see my resume.</p>
