      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! Iâ€™m <strong>Haochen (Eric) Zhou</strong>, an <strong>Economics graduate</strong> from <strong>Kalamazoo College</strong> with a minor in <strong>History</strong>. 
        My background blends analytical rigor with a liberal arts foundation that emphasizes <strong>critical thinking</strong>, <strong>presentation skills</strong>, and <strong>collaborative problem-solving</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I currently work as a <strong>Supply Chain Specialist</strong> at <strong>Trinity Health</strong>, where I manage inventory systems for multiple hospital departments, streamline workflows, and forecast supply needs using data analysis and ERP systems. 
        This experience has strengthened my ability to operate efficiently in fast-paced, data-driven environments.
      </p>

      <p>
        My academic and professional experiences have helped me develop a strong understanding of <strong>data analytics</strong>, <strong>economic research</strong>, and <strong>process optimization</strong> â€” all guided by a curiosity for how thoughtful systems design can drive meaningful results.
      </p>

      <h2>Beyond Work</h2>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m deeply interested in sustainability, history, and the intersection of business and technology. 
        At Kalamazoo College, I presented in forums on the <strong>economics of climate change</strong> and helped implement <strong>environmentally friendly business solutions</strong> across campus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I enjoy researching market trends, exploring efficient systems design, and continuously learning to refine my data and operations skill set.
