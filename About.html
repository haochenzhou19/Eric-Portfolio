      <h2>Hi, I’m Haochen (Eric) Zhou</h2>
      <p>
        I’m an Economics graduate from Kalamazoo College with a passion for data-driven decision-making and process improvement. I currently work as a Supply Chain Specialist at Trinity Health, where I manage and forecast medical inventory across five hospital departments.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my current role, I collaborate with clinical teams and supply chain personnel to ensure efficient product availability and help optimize storage layouts using Oracle PeopleSoft ERP. These experiences have strengthened my skills in inventory management, problem-solving, and operational analytics.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Kalamazoo College, I developed a strong analytical foundation through coursework in economics, health economics, and accounting, along with a minor in history that enhanced my critical thinking and communication skills. I was named to the Dean’s List for academic excellence and contributed to sustainability initiatives, including a presentation on the economic impacts of climate change.

        I have completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, where I gained hands-on experience in data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis using tools such as Excel, SQL, Tableau, and R. This training enhanced my ability to turn data into actionable insights and communicate findings clearly to support informed business decisions.
        In addition, I have successfully completed the Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) and Series 50 certifications, which strengthened my understanding of financial markets, securities regulations, and municipal advisory practices. Together, these credentials reflect my ability to bridge analytical and financial perspectives—applying data-driven insights to guide strategic and operational decision-making..
