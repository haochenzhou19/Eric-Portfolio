      <h2>Hi, Iâ€™m Haochen (Eric) Zhou</h2>

      <p>
        Iâ€™m an Economics graduate with a passion for <strong>data-driven decision-making</strong> and
        <strong>process improvement</strong>. Currently, I work as a Supply Chain Specialist at Trinity Health,
        where I help manage and forecast medical inventory across hospital departments.
      </p>

      <p>
        Working in healthcare supply chain has shown me how complex operations can be â€” from miscommunication
        between teams to wasteful spending on medical products and inefficient inventory setups. These daily
        challenges drive my interest in using analytics to uncover inefficiencies and improve decision-making.
        By leveraging tools like Oracle PeopleSoft ERP, Iâ€™ve learned how small, data-informed changes can
        streamline workflows and support better outcomes.
      </p>

      <p>
        My background in economics and history has shaped how I think and solve problems. Economics trained me
        to interpret data, evaluate trade-offs, and understand how decisions ripple through systems â€” skills
        that translate naturally to optimizing supply chains. History taught me to question assumptions,
        synthesize complex information, and communicate clearly â€” essential traits for making data insights
        actionable in real-world settings.
      </p>

      <p>
        Iâ€™m driven by continuous learning, whether through professional experience or certifications that
        deepen my analytical and financial understanding. I aim to bridge operational expertise with data insight
        to drive smarter, more efficient, and sustainable business decisions.
      </p>

      <p>
      For a full list of my certifications, technical skills, and professional experience,
      please see my resume.
