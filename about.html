      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! Iâ€™m <strong>Haochen (Eric) Zhou</strong>, an <strong>Economics graduate</strong> from <strong>Kalamazoo College</strong> with a minor in <strong>History</strong>. 
        My education blends analytical reasoning with a liberal arts foundation that emphasizes <strong>critical thinking</strong>, <strong>presentation skills</strong>, and <strong>collaborative problem-solving</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I currently work as a <strong>Supply Chain Specialist</strong> at <strong>Trinity Health</strong>, where I manage inventory systems across several hospital departments, coordinate with medical staff to ensure supply availability, and support process improvements that enhance efficiency and organization. 
        This role has given me valuable experience in structured operations and the importance of accurate, timely decision-making in complex environments.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through my academic background and professional work, Iâ€™ve developed a strong conceptual understanding of <strong>data analytics</strong>, <strong>economic research</strong>, and <strong>workflow optimization</strong> â€” helping me approach challenges from both a systems and efficiency perspective.
      </p>
